### About

*Fairly* is an open source initiative dedicated to building inclusive, barrier-free digital experiences.

We're just getting started, but our mission is clear: to help developers create a web that works for everyone.


### Our Vision

Initially, our focus is on making the web more accessible. Over time, we aim to expand our work to promote digital accessibility across all types of software and digital experiences.


### Early Stage

This project is in active development. We're laying the foundation, one accessible line of code at a time.

No tools have been released yet, so this is the perfect opportunity to get involved early and help shape the direction of our work.


### Get Involved

We welcome contributors of all backgrounds. Whether you're writing code, improving documentation, or testing accessibility, you can be part of our mission from the ground up.

- First issues and contribution guidelines will be shared soon.  
- Discussions and roadmap updates coming shortly.

*Accessibility in our tools. Inclusion in our team.*
